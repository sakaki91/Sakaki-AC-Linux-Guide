### Thanks to Collaborators

<p>I would like to personally thank everyone who has helped me and is helping me keep this project alive,
  It really is a lot of work to keep something running, and thanks to the amazing Linux/open source community, 
  we have managed to keep this project running and stable on a few distributions, We plan to expand to as many popular distributions as possible</p> 
<p>I need to thank all the contributors and users who have enthusiastically tested our project,
  It is really cool to see a project that is useful to so many people growing,
  And thanks to the community, I also have a lot to thank the people on Reddit (r/linuxgaming) for their help with dependencies,
  and the great help from the community on ProtonDB. Without them, I would be nothing.
  Many things have been tested multiple times using parts of the ProtonDB experiments.</p>
  <p>I am also very grateful to the contributors of this project and the users who opened issues,
  for helping me better organize this project and for helping me make small fixes, among others that I am about to make. </p>
